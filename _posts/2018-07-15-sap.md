What was it like to intern at SAP Portugal? 
===========================================

### What was the goal of the intership?

The goal of the internship was to use my created code as a sample for a
class in Spring Framework and microservices which was going to be held
by my mentor [Chritstian
Franco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianborges/) to the SAP CX
Commerce.

### How did I prepare?

In order to be ready for this internship I had to learn Java and some
Java 8 specific methods as well as understand RESTFul web services.

### What tasks did I do?

Before my main and final assignment I did several others. I wrote a
document on the groovy language and highlighting its differences against
Java, I had to read some papers on SCRUM and answer a questionnaire with
SCRUM related questions, I had a presentation on software Craftsmanship,
I learned the design patterns (Facade pattern, Service pattern,
Repository pattern, Singleton pattern, MVC pattern and Strategy
pattern), I got to go along a team working day from the Ericsson project
(watched the prints, daily meeting, the dry run presentation and the
agile task board on jira) and I also did some small Java programs before
the big one.

### The final project

I’ll start with the description, then the requirements and my thoughts.

#### Description

Develop a Microservice based on Spring Boot in order to serve RESTFul
web services for E-Commerce platforms.

#### Requirements

* Use Trello to create the Agile Task Board.
* Create the relational mapping in JPA based on given the UML class
diagram.
* Use the "Software Craftsmanship” and “Good Practices” concepts.
* Create integration and unit tests.
* The endpoints must be RESTFul and use JSON payloads.
* Must respect the enterprise pattern (Controller -\> Facade -\>
Service -\> Repository).
*  Must use the new Java8 resources such as Stream API, Optionals and
Lambdas.
* Must use the following technologies: IntelliJ IDEA, MAVEN, Spring
Boot, Git, RESTFul services, Spring Data, JPA Entities, Lombok project,
JSON, Apache Lang Uitls e Google Guava

The project was pretty much a full e-commerce backend developed from
scratch using Spring Boot. I had to create the models and their
relations (showed in the class diagram up next) and all the methods
associated with their usage.

#### Overview of the main technologies used

Scrum Framework, Spring Boot, Java 8, SAP CX Commerce, UML, Maven,
Spring MVC, H2 DB, Spring Data and Spring Rest Controllers.

#### Overview of the main concepts used

E-commerce challenges and solutions, Design Patterns, Object Oriented
Programming (OOP), Microservices, Authentitacion VS Authorization, Team
work, Agile, Clena Code, TDD, Enterprise Back ends and RESTFul APIs.

### What was the experience like

The whole team had a pretty chilled and good working environment. I stayed there between 15 July - 15 August.
Everyone gets along really well and they can ask each other questions or
share some cool stuff they did and it’s a really good place to work at.
I always had lunch in the office with a bunch of team mates and they
were all super nice. Most of them were really smart and good at their
job which created some really interesting chats where they all had a lot
of opinions and insights which they shared with me. I learned a lot at
SAP, both programming wise and in a more personal way. I recommend it to
everyone who would like to do a 1 month internship on web development to
give it a look.

### My Evaluation

My mentor gave me a score of 20 in a 0-20 scale. He wrote an internhip
evaluation which you can check
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FauCoJ-kA9Utp0EU08fOkeQwj5crU1ku/view?usp=sharing).
The whole internhip went really well and at the end I was invited to
work there after I finished college.
