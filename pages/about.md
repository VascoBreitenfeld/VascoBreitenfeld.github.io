Born in 1999, I'm a Mechanical Enginnering student at ISEL in Lisbon. Since very young I've been fond of machines and thats why I choose them as a career. I participated in the building process of the ADESS-03 EVO 2020 LMP3 prototype during a summer internship, my first step in the world of racing . My love for Motorsport is what drives me and my goal is to design and build the fastest cars possible, finding that balance between areodynamics and raw power that give them the edge over all others!
