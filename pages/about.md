My name is Vasco Breitenfeld and I’m a Mechanical Engineering student at ISEL in Lisbon. I chose this path because of my love for Motorsport, and in particular Formula racing. I watch F1 because of my father, ever since I can remember. Last year(2019) I got my first taste of Motorsport with an internship at ADESS AG where I spent the summer building the ADESS 03 2020 EVO LMP3 prototype, where I witnessed and participated in the process of building, troubleshooting and even testing the car! After my internship I signed up for my university’s formula student team (ISEL Formula Student) of which I’m currently a member in the Vehicle Dynamics department. Formula student is a brilliant way to learn all about engineering, design but most importantly teamwork and how the real world works. 

My favorite are is by far aerodynamics, I find the ways air can be shaped to create a path around every element of the car, minimizing drag while increasing downforce to be fascinating. This is the area I wish to pursue both in future study’s as well as professionally. 
That said I’m also  very interested in all vehicle dynamics areas, in my time in the formula student team I’ve studied elements of the suspension of the IFS03e car and enjoyed it a lot. 

My ultimate goal is to work in Motorsport, I find nothing gives me such a rush as a good race. But a good race means lots of high skilled drivers, mechanics, managers and engineers, and that’s the community I one day would like to be a part off. I think that if you put me in that environment, I will give 110% of what I have and be happy and proud of every day of work.
